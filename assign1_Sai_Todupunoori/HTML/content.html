    <h1 id="descr">CIS 2336-INTERNET APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, SEMESTER FALL 2020</h1>
    <i><b><p class="desc">CIS 2336 is a one-semester, sophomore level course that introduces many technologies that contribute to sophisticated information systems and applications readily available via the World Wide Web and Internet today. The technologies include markup languages such as HTML and XML, structured data formats such as JSON, CSS for styling HTML, client-side coding for building dynamic and interactive applications using ECMA6 compliant JavaScript and the Vue.js framework, and server-side coding for enabling and building dynamic and interactive content into applications.</p>
    <p class="desc">Because the technologies are many, the course provides an overview and introduction together with hands-on exercises and assignments.
        The only way to become proficient with these technologies is to work with them hands-on, possibly for many, many hours. Thus, proficiency in one semester is not possible, but an overview of the technologies with some hands-on experience is. That is what the course delivers along with a conceptual understanding of how the different pieces work together to deliver the high-quality web applications of today's World Wide Web. The course provides a foundation for more in depth learning and prepares students for upper division courses and projects in CIS. In addition, students are asked to reflect on the organizational context for web sites and web applications. E-commerce is a huge and important economic sector, and it is destined to continue to grow. Students need to understand that, while Internet technologies are interesting in and of themselves, they are commercially interesting only within an organizational context.</p>
